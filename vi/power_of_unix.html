<h1>The Power of Unix</h1>
<!-- This is from Wikipedia -->
<p>From  “Program Design in the UNIX Environment” (1984) by  Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike</p>

<!-- There are more great ideas about Unix. -->
<p>Much of the power of the UNIX operating system comes from a style of program design that makes programs easy to use and, more important, easy to combine with other programs. This style has been called the use of software tools, and depends more on how the programs fit into the programming environment and how they can be used with other programs than on how they are designed internally. [...] This style was based on the use of tools: using programs separately or in combination to get a job done, rather than doing it by hand, by monolithic self-sufficient subsystems, or by special-purpose, one-time programs.</p>
